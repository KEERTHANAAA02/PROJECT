# PROJECT
This project builds a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset. It combines content-based filtering (based on genres) and collaborative filtering (based on user ratings) to suggest top 5 personalized movie recommendations. A user-friendly Streamlit interface is used for input and display.
